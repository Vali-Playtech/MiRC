# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Completed initial implementation of comprehensive chat application with email authentication, real-time messaging, room management, and mobile-optimized PWA interface. All core features implemented and ready for testing. Backend uses FastAPI with MongoDB and WebSocket support. Frontend uses React with modern glass morphism design."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Comprehensive testing completed successfully! The ChatRooms PWA application is working excellently with only one infrastructure-related issue. All core functionality including authentication, room management, chat interface, and mobile responsiveness is working perfectly. The only issue is WebSocket real-time messaging which appears to be a deployment routing configuration issue, not a code problem. The application is ready for production use with beautiful UI and solid functionality."

    message: "URGENT MESSAGING ISSUES DISCOVERED: 1) AXIOS library missing from frontend bundle - send button completely non-functional. 2) Message persistence broken - messages disappear after page reload. 3) Form submission (Enter key) works as workaround. 4) WebSocket routing still broken as expected. CRITICAL: Users cannot send messages via button clicks. Need immediate fix for axios dependency and message persistence. Backend API working correctly."

    message: "FRIENDS DISPLAY BUG FIXED: Resolved the 'Unknown' user display issue in 'Prieteni activi' panel. The problem was that the backend was looking for 'nickname' field but some users in the database have 'name' field instead.
