The trajectory details the iterative development of the VONEX PWA. Initially, the AI engineer addressed two critical bugs: a nickname/name inconsistency in the friends panel and a chat input clearing issue. Following this, significant effort was invested in branding, including multiple logo and slogan iterations. The core of the recent work revolved around a major UI/UX overhaul, transitioning to a tabbed interface. The AI engineer successfully implemented the World Chat tab with Facebook-style posting, link previews, and image uploads, refined with a single input field and a responsive layout. The Camerele mele tab was also fully implemented with room creation and management. The Favori»õi tab underwent a complete redesign from a circular layout to a WhatsApp/Messenger-style vertical sidebar. The current work focuses on refining the avatars in the Favori»õi sidebar to display actual profile pictures with status borders instead of initials.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the avatar display within the Favori»õi tab's WhatsApp/Messenger-style sidebar. The user explicitly requested that the avatars should display user profile pictures instead of initials, with a subtle colored border (green for online, grey for offline) and a small colored dot to indicate status.

The AI engineer has already made the following changes in :
1.  Modified the rendering logic for avatars in the  to expect and use a  URL for each user.
2.  Implemented conditional styling to display a green border and dot for online users () and a grey border and dot for offline users ().
3.  Updated the mock  data to include placeholder  URLs for each user, allowing the new rendering logic to be tested with visual content.

The goal is to eliminate the letters previously seen inside the avatars and replace them with a more polished and informative display using actual profile pictures and visual online/offline indicators.
