The trajectory details the evolution of the VONEX PWA. Initially, the AI engineer resolved two critical bugs: an Unknown user display in the friends panel due to a / database schema inconsistency, fixed by adding backward compatibility in . The second bug involved the chat input field not clearing after message submission, particularly when using the send button, which was a React state management race condition. This was resolved by immediately clearing the  state at the beginning of the  function in .

Following bug fixes, a significant focus shifted to branding and UI/UX. The user iterated through several design requests for the VONEX logo, moving from a retro-digital SVG to a more pronounced glitch style, and finally to using an original PNG logo. The logo was then resized and repositioned within the header and login page, culminating in the integration of a new slogan, Voice • Opinions • Network • Experiences. This slogan underwent multiple refinements for positioning, styling, and textual accuracy.

The most recent phase involved a major architectural redesign, transitioning the application from a simple chat to a complex social platform with a tabbed interface. The user provided detailed requirements for World Chat, Camera ta, Favoriți, Camere urmărite/recente, and Search tabs. The AI engineer, after confirming the plan, began implementing the new tabbed header and the World Chat interface, including a post creation area and placeholders for other sections. The last user request was to refine the tab appearance, making them uniform bubbles and removing emojis.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing a major UI/UX overhaul for the VONEX application. The user requested a new tabbed interface after login, replacing the previous simple room list.

The AI engineer successfully implemented the initial structure of this new interface:
-   A new header was created in  (around line 2200) that now features five distinct tabs: World Chat, Camera ta, Favoriți, Recente, and Search.
-   The World Chat tab was partially implemented, displaying a descriptive header (Cameră globală publică • Oricine poate posta), a motivational welcome screen (with a globe emoji and text), and a functional post creation area. This area includes a textarea for messages, an input for URLs (intended for link previews), and a Postează button with a gradient design.
-   Placeholder screens with appropriate emojis and messages were added for the other four tabs (Camera ta, Cercul Favoriților, Camere Recente, Search) to show the structure.
-   The navigation between these tabs is functional, with visual active states and responsive design for different screen sizes.

The last explicit request from the user was: Scoate faviconurile si fa taburile ca niste bule, cum este cea de la World Chat (Chat Message 293). This means the current task is to modify the appearance of the tabs: remove the current emoji icons and ensure all tabs are visually consistent, styled as rounded bubbles similar to the active World Chat tab.

Adjust the frontend  to remove emojis from tabs and style all tabs as rounded bubbles.
